    "The basic idea of this course is to teach students basic statistics and computer programming under the guise of basketball and keeping track of statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students will have class two days a week. The first day will be spent actually playing basketball. At least one student (or teacher) will spend time tracking statistics for each player, including rebounds, blocks, FGA, FGM, 3PA, 3PM, steals, assists (a little harder to track). Kids love to track stats\n",
    "\n",
    "The students will be REQUIRED to participate in the class. Keeping them in line will happen with a board for \"minus playing time\". Talking out of class or using the laptops for things other than programming will result in a forced benching for a certain time in the gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "First lecture will be looking at statistics for certain famous basketball players over time... Of course I'll have to talk trash about Larry Bird and Paul Pierce being better than MJ. But we'll look at the basic statistics as well as the more advaned analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every lecture from then on will involve manipulating the students' own statistics. We will need access to the wifi, but hopefully we can disable google chrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stat keeping can maybe be done in excel(?) or some kind of GUI. Ideally the students can then access their stats via SSH on linux powered machines. This way we can teach them basic command line skills, which can help set a framework for more advanced programming down the line.\n",
